# Themes for Gedit 3

Version 0.1.0

---

This is based on the infamous mig/gedit-themes repository, but since it seems to be stagnant and not accepting pull
requests anymore I decided it was time to make things happen again. This fixes the install script and updates some
themes that looked terrible when the option to highlight the current line was selectd.

The install script could use some more work, but should be fully functional as it is. Pull requests are welcomed.

## Changelog

### 0.2.0
 - Completely redesign install script to be more flexible and fail proof

### 0.1.0
 - Replace install script with new one that works with Gedit 3
 - Remove railscasts2 and Rainbow Neon themes
 - Modify some themes that had no defined background color for current-line so that it always looks good
 
## Acknowledgements

This theme bundle is based on the work of Matthew Swasey (mig). Also includes a build script which is heavily inspired
by the installer script of Solarized for Gedit by Matthew Cantelon (mattcan).
